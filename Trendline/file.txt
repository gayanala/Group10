1st Book Reaction

	I have never been an avid reader of poetry nor have I ever checked a book out from the Reinert-Alumni Library; thus, in an effort to both complete this first paper and fulfill a personal goal of becoming more worldly, I have picked up a copy of E. E. Cummings’ 73 poems.  I scanned the contents page and was surprised to find the various titles of Cummings’ 73 poems, which include: it’s, plant Magic dust, nite), and (a personal favorite) everybody happy?.  I knew immediately that this was not the kind of book that could be read just anywhere, but rather, that I was going to need to find a secluded spot and dedicate some serious thought on these words.  So naturally I headed to the Jesuit Gardens for a brief break from the day.  The first poem, which I read, goes a little something like this:
				seeker of truth

				follow no path
				all paths lead where

				truth is here
This poem spoke to me on a personal level, as I would like to consider myself a seeker of truth; however, Cummings did not make the task of deciphering his words an easy one.  And so I became a seeker of meaning.
	There are several ways to interpret the meaning of this poem and I believe these differing viewpoints are revealed by grouping lines together in various combinations.  The easiest way is to group lines the way they have been provided.  Seeker of truth is meant to grab the seeker’s attention and then the next two lines are a command and a question: follow no path because all paths lead where?  This place “where” is not a place that can be traveled to, but simply is.  Thus the final line is the revelation that truth is HERE, right where the seeker was to begin with.  There needs not be a voyage to discover truth because no path leads to truth.  This is a way of logically interpreting the text, which is the first way I explored his words.  The second way I explored the words of Cummings’ poem was by letting it speak to me.
	Perhaps it sounds cliché that I let a piece of art speak to me, but this is not something that I do regularly.  I really wanted to explore what Cummings had to offer and so I let his words sit on my brain and flow over my tongue a few times to get a handle on what was being said.  And as I was doing this, the most amazing thing happened.  I began to have a conversation with myself.  I would say the line, “seeker of truth,” and internally I would respond, “Hello!”  This continued to create a type of dialogue between myself and Cummings.

				seeker of truth
					Hello! 
				
				follow no path	
					Done.  I have been cutting my own trial a long time.
				all paths lead where
					They lead where someone has already been.
				truth is here 
					And I am going to find it.  But first I need to learn to open my eyes.
